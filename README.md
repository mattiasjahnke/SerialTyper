# SerialTyper

SerialTyper is a simple utility tool that lives in your menu bar and sends keyboard events (ascii keycodes) to a serial port that the app is connected to.

## Carthage
SerialTyper uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to manage dependencies.

Run `carthage update` to download and compile the required frameworks.

## Usage
Select a port and a baud rate - SerialTyper will automatically try to connect to the port.

## Todo
- Improve Error handling
- Add more configuration
- Automatically connect when a port becomes available
